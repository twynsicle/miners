# Miners - How to Play

## Game Overview
Miners is a multiplayer board game where players compete to build mining paths using cards. The game combines strategy and planning as players try to create the most efficient paths to reach their destinations.

## Game Components
- A 9x9 game board (81 spaces)
- A deck of path cards
- Multiple destination points
- Starting position

## Setup
1. The game starts with:
   - A starting card placed in the middle of the 8th row
   - Three destination cards placed on the 2nd row (positions 2, 4, and 6)
   - Each player receives a hand of 6 cards

## Game Rules

### Basic Gameplay
1. Players take turns clockwise, starting with the first player
2. On your turn, you can:
   - Place one card from your hand onto an empty space on the board
   - After placing a card, you automatically draw a new card to maintain 6 cards in your hand

### Card Placement Rules
1. Cards can only be placed adjacent to existing cards on the board
   - The card must be adjacent to at least one existing non-destination card
   - Destination cards don't count as adjacent cards for placement purposes
2. Paths must connect properly with adjacent cards
   - Each path on your card must properly connect with paths on adjacent cards
   - Paths are considered connected if they meet at the shared edge between cards
   - Destination cards automatically connect with any adjacent paths
3. The new card must form at least one continuous path back to the starting card
   - This path must be made up of connected path segments
   - The path cannot go through destination cards
   - The path must be traceable through adjacent cards back to the start

### Winning the Game
The game continues until players create continuous paths from the starting position to the destination cards. (Full winning conditions to be determined as the game develops)

## Game Board Layout
- The board is a 9x9 grid
- Starting position: 8th row, middle column
- Destination cards: 2nd row, positions 2, 4, and 6
